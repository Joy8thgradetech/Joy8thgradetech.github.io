            The goal of this project was to create an arm prostetic that would launch a ball across a vitural feild and hit a target. We had constantly had to tweak, change, and adjust things like our arm angle,forearm length, to the very amount of rubber bands to add to the arm. After lanuching the ball we would gain infomration about our prosthetic like the Hight, Launch Angle, Initial Velocity, and kinetic energy released. From there we would change numbers into decimals and race to see who could not only finish first but get the ball <b> exactly </b> on target.

The app has a wide range of applications, including in the worlds of architecture, interior design, landscaping, and video game design. Sketchup has also found success with people who want to create, share, or download 3D models for use with 3D printers.</h4>

             VEX Robotics is a robitics kit that promotes creativity, problem solving and teamwork through the engineering of a robot. The kit provides students with all the materials, maual instuctions, and a coded remote controller. In addition to learning valuable engineering skills, students gain life skills such as teamwork, perseverance, communication, collaboration, project management, and critical thinking.

We also learned many tech terms and abbreviations that will help us understand exactly what HTML is. With StudioWeb we learned HTML basics such as how where specific types of HTML code belongs, how to keep our work spaces organize and a short basic video on how  HTML handles video, audio and images.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once and funky fonts, backgrounds, and designs to a plan webpage.
